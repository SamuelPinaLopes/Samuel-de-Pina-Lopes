This is me, I can solve your problem, so let's talk a little and see that, OK?. I also like to work on open-source projects, if you have one, talk to me!

I'm learning programming and improving my skills with git, GitHub, and real projects.
Currently learning: git, GitHub, software organization, c++, python and javascript.
tolls I use: VS code, git, windows 11
Goals: build useful open-source projects and share my learning journey (have a job as well)

Thanks for visiting my profile, feel free to check my repositories and follow my progress.
